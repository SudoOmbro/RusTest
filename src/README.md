# RUST TEST

My first rust project to test out the language. It's a sort of database with import/export from/to csv files and some sorting options.

## Goals

- Base Rust setup (cargo compiler + VS Code extension).
- Learn Rust basics (syntax, borrowing, standard library, modules, etc...).
- Learn how to make a CLI.
- Learn how to do OOP.
- Learn random generation.
- Learn Error handling.
